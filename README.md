## 1. Introduction to Deep Learning

-	**Deep Learning** is a class of machine learning algorithms which depends on the structure and function of the brain called **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.
-	The term **Deep Learning** was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986 and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000.
-	It uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from raw input.
-	The term `deep` in deep learning refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed.
-	In deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation.
-	Deep learning systems have a substantial `credit assignment path` (CAP) depth.
-	The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially casual connections between input and output. 
-	Deep learning architectures are often constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. 
-	Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.
-	Deep Learning systems are based on Neural Networks.
-	So, I will first discuss Neural Networks.
